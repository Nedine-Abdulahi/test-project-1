# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **NAME**

Time spent: **#** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[No outside resources used. However, I did look though the resources provided and clicked through the detailed explenations to further my understanding of the game's implentation.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[During my attempt to add an additional feature into the game, it became more of a challenge than I initially expected. While I was working within the javascript file the simple addition I had in my mind was to add a variable to measure how many attempts the user makes during the round. After making that variable I was intending to make a conditional statement that would allow the user to make another attempt if he was only at one attempt but quit the game once he makes more than 2 failed attempts. So, as I went to test my original plan, I noticed that my plan did not work as intended. As a way to determine that the problem did not stem from my newly created variable I referred back to the guide and learned that I could use the “console.log()” method to verify the variable's usage. From this test, I realized that I made the variable allow the use of a retry in every round even though I intended for there to only be one retry for the entirety of the game. Essentially, I was able to overcome the challenge by referring back to the basis and working up from there. This has and will hopefully continue to work for me as the foundation for any project must be sturdy to maintain the integrity of the rest of the project.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[A  genuine question I have for web development is why there is not as open access for this field. Had it not been out of my curiosity, I would have never stumbled upon this opportunity to learn a valuable skill. Through this project I feel comfortably ushered into the community; however, I understand that my case was of pure luck and someone who shares a similar interest in the field would probably not receive the same opportunity. So, that leaves me wondering why more schools do not attempt to incorporate valuable skills into the high-school curriculum especially in schools where it has not been exposed to such as the many underrepresented communities across America. Additionally, if one were to give a recommendation to a student that gained interest from completing this project, how would one direct them through this learning process.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[Given that I had more time for the project the initial steps I would have done is to dramatically increase the number of boxes while also making the changes within the boxes less evident. I would make the changes less visible by making the color change less noticeable and decrease the duration in which the color would be brightened for. After making the game considerably harder it would encourage more competition for the users while simultaneously helping to improve their memory. Although not everyone's memory may not be at the same level I would incorporate different difficulty levels where I capitalize more on the ideas of allowed attempts. To appeal more to the users  I would add a sign for the users to keep a record of there attempts made so they do to get lost despite the difficulty of the rounds. For instance, the easier levels would have less boxes with more allowed attempts than other levels. Although this is an initial idea that came to mind, most of the additions to the game would derive from sample users themselves. My steps after making my desired game would be to allow friends, family, and mentors to receive feedback from it. Feedback is essential in improving any project's quality so it is surely a step that I would not leave out given additional time.]
